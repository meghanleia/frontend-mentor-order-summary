## Overview

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

 This page was built using semantic HTML5 markup and CSS flexbox. You can follow my coding journey at https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/meghanleia. 

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should also be able to see the hover states for interactive elements.

### Design Images

These are the designs I was aiming to replicate. The second image is the active state for the interactive elements.
